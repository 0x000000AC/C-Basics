Note on Continue and Break

- Break can terminate out of a loop condition prematurely
- Generally not the most advisable thing.  Break and continue
can make a program hard to follow.

break;

- Continue statement is similar.  At the point that
the continue statement happens, any loop iteration that
occurs after is skipped.
- Most often used to bypass a group of statements inside
a loop based on some condition, but to otherwise continue
execution of the loop

continue;
