Variants of for loops

- You can include multiple expressions in any of the fields 
for the loop as long as you separate the expressions by commas

for ( i = 0, j = 0; i < 10; ++i )
	...

for ( i = 0, j = 100; i < 10; ++i, j = j - 10 )
	...
	
- You can leave one of the fields blank as long as you keep the
semicolon in place.

for ( ; j != 100; ++j )
	...
	
- If you admit the loop_condition, you can effectively set up for 
an infinite loop that is theoretically executed forever.  You can have
a return, break, or goto 

for ( init_expression; loop_condition; loop_loop expression )

- Equivalent for and while loops

for ( init_expression; loop_condition; loop_expression ) 
	program statement

can be equivalently expressed in the form of a while statement as

init_expression;
while ( loop_condition ) {
program statement loop_expression;
}
